Feel free to use this, as the info I have was used from online searching.
(ALSO! I AM VERY NEW TO CODING, PLEASE DONT JUDGE AND IF YOU HAVE ANY TIPS PLEASE LET ME KNOW.)
As for why I have made this is because phishing tends to happen a lot these days, especially with the older people of society, And as someone with a heart I can't stand by and just let it happen without TRYING to say something
But that's all I have to say about this. Have a good day and stay safe online
